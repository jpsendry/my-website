    <p class="lead mt-4">
      Turkey is experiencing an escalating water crisis driven by a mix of environmental, economic, and human pressures. This issue, once considered seasonal, now poses a long-term threat to communities, agriculture, and ecosystems across the country.

    <p class="lead mt-5">
      <strong>Climate Change & Drought:</strong> Turkey’s shifting climate patterns have led to hotter summers, decreased rainfall, and diminished snowpack in the mountains. These changes have reduced the replenishment of water reserves and triggered longer drought cycles.
    </p>

    <p class="lead mt-4">
      <strong>Overuse in Agriculture:</strong> Nearly 3/4 of Turkey’s freshwater is used for agriculture—often through outdated and wasteful irrigation methods. This excessive use depletes groundwater faster than it can naturally recover.
    </p>

    <p class="lead mt-4">
      <strong>Urbanization & Infrastructure Strain:</strong> Rapid population growth and poorly planned urban development have overwhelmed water infrastructure. Leaky pipelines, inefficient systems, and paved-over green spaces all contribute to the crisis.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">Parched farmland reflects the combined effect of climate shifts and unsustainable farming practices.</p>

    <p class="lead mt-4">
      <strong>Pollution & Mismanagement:</strong> Industrial discharge, untreated wastewater, and weak policy enforcement contaminate precious water sources. Fragmented water governance further delays coordinated solutions.
    </p>

    <p class="lead mt-4">
      <strong>Lack of Public Awareness:</strong> Water conservation isn’t widely practiced. Many households and businesses are unaware of how simple changes—like fixing leaks or updating irrigation—could make a big difference.
    </p>

    <p class="lead fw-semibold mt-5">
      Turkey's water future depends on innovation, cooperation, and a shift in everyday behavior. Solutions start with understanding the problem.
