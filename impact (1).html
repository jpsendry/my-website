    <p class="lead mt-4">
      The effects of Turkey’s water crisis are being felt across every sector of society—from agriculture to urban life. The shortage of clean, accessible water is no longer a distant threat—it’s a present reality disrupting communities and ecosystems.

    <p class="lead mt-5">
      <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Lakes, rivers, and wetlands are drying up. Biodiversity is under threat as habitats shrink and water temperatures rise, affecting aquatic life and surrounding ecosystems.
    </p>

    <p class="lead mt-4">
      <strong>Agricultural Struggles:</strong> Farmers face dwindling irrigation supplies, leading to reduced crop yields and lost income. Regions that depend on agriculture for their economy are seeing rising instability and rural depopulation.
    </p>

    <p class="lead mt-4">
      <strong>Urban Water Stress:</strong> Cities across Turkey are experiencing more frequent water cuts, rationing, and reliance on tanker trucks. As demand grows, access to reliable and safe drinking water is becoming more uncertain.

    <p class="text-muted">Relief efforts become critical as water scarcity amplifies food insecurity and public health risks.</p>

    <p class="lead mt-4">
      <strong>Social & Economic Consequences:</strong> Water scarcity fuels inequality. Low-income communities often bear the brunt of water shortages, and businesses struggle with rising utility costs, threatening economic stability.
    </p>

    <p class="lead fw-semibold mt-5">
      The water crisis is more than an environmental issue—it’s a humanitarian and economic emergency that demands collective action.
